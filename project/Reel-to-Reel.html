                        <p> Reel to Reel tape recording is a format that is still used to this day, before digital
                            avenues
                            to create and record music was introduced. The reel to reel tape machine remained industry
                            standard
                            at any studio. There are many variations to a tape machine such as this, most machines
                            are able to record anywhere between 4-24 tracks. Thats it thats all folks! In addition,
                            different
                            machines have different widths or size of magnetic tape that the machine uses to record. All
                            ranging between
                            1/4 inch to 2 inch tape.

                        <p> As my prefered way to record and document my own music. There is a special thing about
                            reel to reel tape recording. There is an iconic warm tonality working on physical machines
                            with
                            mechanical components, that cannot be replicated elseware. Many times, due to the limitation
                            of how many tracks a machine has to record. You are often put in the position to "trim the
                            fat"
                            of a song and focus on the core parts and instruments that really drive how a song and
                            quality recording.
