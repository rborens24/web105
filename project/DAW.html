                        <p> A digital audio workspace is an electronic computer based software used to
                            record music. There are multiple suites or companies offering a DAW.
                            They are now considered to be the industry standard as to how records are made. The rise
                            of the DAW came from the technicological boom of the late 90s and early 2000s which prompted
                            studios to become more computer based after the invention of the now obsolete CD format.

                        <p> As seen the photo, a DAW allows for accesability when it comes to recording.
                            The bar for entry is very low. If you have a computer and a few other pieces of gear,
                            you can start right up in recording. DAWs range from free to thousands of dollars.
                            All depending on the amount of features the user desires.
