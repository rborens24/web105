                        A part of traveling for me is I'd like to feel small.
                        I'd like to look out into something vast, in which centers me to the reality of how
                        small I am in the grand scheme of things. Switzerland feels like a place in which could do so,
                        with large mountain ranges and smaller farming communities. I hope it could take me to a place
                        of
                        appreciation and admiration for the beauty of the world.
