                        San Francisco for me is always been a go-to dream spot. As a musician many of my favorite bands
                        came from a 2000's era garage rock scene that sprung up in San Franscisco.
                        I am enamored by the art scene and culture that exsists throughout that city.
                        In addition, It seems like such a strange, yet put together place in which has a business, tech
                        world vibe. While also having this kind of sketchy art scene vibe.
                        One of my favorite things about this location is that, the rolling hills throughout the city
                        look like something out of a Dr. Seuss book!
