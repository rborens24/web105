                        As of last year November, my girlfriend and I visited Toronto.
                        It was a spontaneous trip in which we quickly learned that it was too cold!
                        Along the way we visited a part of downtown Toronto called The Kensington Market, and area full
                        of small business and re-sale shops.
                        We both walked away with some neat clothing and vintage items. I look forward to returning,
                        hopefully during a warmer season.
