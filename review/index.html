    <h1>Due Date</h1>

    <h2>Todd Philips</h2>

    <h3>Overview of story</h3>


    <P>Due date is a film about an ever flustered business man in a swirl of angst before the birth
        of his first child. Played by Robert Downey Jr. his character Peter Highman is in an obvious binge
        of consumption to make sure everything goes according to plan in regards to his wife’s birthing experience.
        His trademarked anxiety is shown via a barrage of voicemail’s left to his wife about possible names for the
        baby,
        how everything will be perfect, he is indeed so in love! Of course the movie is predicated on the fact, that
        everything
        that can go wrong will go wrong. This is where we meet the antagonist in the story, Ethan Tremblay. Played by
        Zac Galifinakis. </P>

    <P>The two characters meet as Peter is rushing to the airport to board a flight back to Los Angeles where his wife
        is having a baby.
        Upon his arrival, he is shocked by the door of his taxi car being taken out by a speeding vehicle. This of
        course is the car in which Ethan Tremblay is exiting.
        The two exchange words, which leads to the mix up of their luggage. As Peter rushes through airport security, he
        arrives on aboard the plane. And what do you know?
        Ethan is the seat behind him. The two exchange unpleasant words in which garners attention. Which then leads to
        their removal off the plane.
        They are then forced to ride along together in a rental car to Los Angeles, with an onslaught of bumps and road
        blocks on the way. To say the least!
        To understand their relationship here is a brief exchange during the initial stages of their journey.
        <q>“Peter
            Highman: I despise who you are on a cellular level.
            Ethan Tremblay: Okay, I've heard that before and I'm trying to work on it”.</P>
    </q>

    <P>
        The movie approaches the situation with but logic. It is a comedy movie full of laughs predicated on the fact
        that multiple scenarios in which the
        two character’s experiences are ridiculous and outrageous. Such as, being kicked off a plane by a U.S Marshall
        because Ethan said the word bomb.
        Which got them on a no fly list. Or their heroic escape from Mexico as they accidentally wandered into the
        U.S-Mexico border because they were high.
        This scenario lead them to be held captive by Mexican border patrol agents in which Ethan embarks on a mission
        to break them free by hijacking a law
        enforcement vehicle from Mexican Authorities. This same vehicle was then used to drive half way across the
        country. Not realistic, but tremendously hilarious.
        The adventures that two strangers fall into, filled with laughs and humor. While you watch you sense the hatred
        toward Ethan coming from Peter. All this remains
        because Ethan is the cause of this whole mess. It is a constant push and pull between, bickering, fighting and
        laughing of the two characters.</P>

    <P>Despite all the outrageous and unrealistic scenarios seen in the film, you laughter is then curtailed into the
        larger sentiment of the film. That is,
        how two strangers meet under circumstances that are less than ideal to then become friends in the end. You're
        left with a sore stomach from laughter but a sentiment
        or ethos, although cheesy. Nonetheless, that friendship is a very important thread to our existence. </P>
